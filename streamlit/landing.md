# SURF: Systems and causal Understanding for Recommendations on global Fisheries

## About

Overfishing is rarely caused by a single action of a single actor. Rather, it is typically influenced by multiple behaviors by multiple actors across a supply chain. Similarly, a single intervention will rarely result in a more sustainable fishery. Rather, a portfolio of interventions is necessary to trigger desired changes. Because fisheries are complex systems, it is challenging to identify interventions with the greatest leverage to positively impact fishing sustainability.

We are using a portfolio of tools from system dynamics to explore the potential for change in five small-scale fisheries in the Humboldt Current Ecosystem. The discipline of system dynamics is well poised to provide insights for developing and evaluating strategies to transition towards sustainability. First, it allows for the mapping of problems from a whole-systems perspective and can capture important non-linear dynamics (e.g., feedback loops). Second, system mapping can be done with stakeholders using established methodologies, resulting in group mental models of fisheries systems. Third, active and potential interventions can be then integrated into system maps. Fourth, a portfolio of qualitative and quantitative analyses can be applied that provide key insights into three broad and important questions:

1. What are the main elements or drivers of the system?
2. What elements hold the most potential for change?
3. What are the most strategic ways to intervene within a system to promote intended consequences and avoid unintended consequences?

Focused on three fisheries in Chile (southern hake, octopus, and anchovy) and two fisheries in Peru (octopus and jumbo flying squid), we have developed a framework that allows us to move rapidly from 1) co-mapping fisheries systems and their core problems with stakeholders to 2) characterizing interventions and what elements they target within the systems to 3) providing accessible analyses that inform where and how to intervene in the system to maximize leverage for change. The framework can be applied to systems with a low- and high-levels of available information.
